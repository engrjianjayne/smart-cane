            <p>Arduino (/ɑːrˈdwiːnoʊ/) is an Italian open-source hardware and software company, project, and user
                community that designs and manufactures single-board microcontrollers and microcontroller kits for
                building digital devices. Its software is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) or
                the GNU General Public License (GPL), which allows anybody to manufacture Arduino boards and distribute
                the software. Its hardware goods are licensed under a CC BY-SA license. Arduino boards can be purchased
                commercially from approved distributors or the official website</p>
            <p>Numerous microprocessors and controllers are used in Arduino board designs. Various extension boards
                (also known as "shields"), breadboards (for prototyping), and other circuits can be interfaced with the
                boards' sets of digital and analog input/output (I/O) pins. In addition to being utilized for program
                loading, the boards have serial communications interfaces, such as Universal Serial Bus (USB) on certain
                variants. In addition to using conventional compiler toolchains, the Arduino project offers an
                integrated development environment (IDE) and a command line tool created in Go. The microcontrollers can
                be programmed using the C and C++ programming languages (Embedded C) and a standard API, also known as
                the Arduino Programming Language, which is inspired by the Processing language and used with a modified
                version of the Processing IDE.</p>

            <p class="indentation">In the realm of technological innovation, the quest for
                inclusive solutions has paved the way for
                groundbreaking advancements aimed at improving the lives of individuals with diverse needs. Among those
                who face unique challenges in their daily lives, the visually impaired community stands out, grappling
                with obstacles that hinder their mobility and independence (Wang Y, 2019). Addressing this pressing
                issue, our proposed device is an automated one, which helps a visually impaired person detect obstacles
                either through beeps or vibrations allowing him to walk confidently and smartly even in a crowded area.
                According to the World Health Organization (WHO), it is estimated that approximately 1.3 billion people
                live with some form of vision impairment. Thus, we have come up with a solution of this innovation using
                multidisciplinary subjects which is reliable and cost-effective (Das et al., 2019).

            <!-- Smart Cane 3D Model -->
            <p class="center">Figure 2 Smart Cane 3D Model</p>
            <p class="indentation">The smart cane consists of several components, including
                an Arduino microcontroller, ultrasonic sensors, a vibration motor, and a speaker. The ultrasonic sensors
                are used to detect obstacles in the user's path and send signals to the Arduino, which then activates
                the vibration motor to alert the user. The speaker is used to provide auditory cues, such as directions
                or warnings of nearby obstacles. This feature is particularly useful for individuals who are unfamiliar
                with their surroundings particularly who are visually impaired. The design of the smart cane is also
                focused on safety and durability. The device is lightweight and compact, making it easy to carry and
                maneuver. It is also designed to withstand the wear and tear of
                daily use, with a sturdy construction and waterproof casing.

            <!-- Flowchart -->
            <h2>Flowchart</h2>
            <div class="fakeimg"><img class="img-st" src="images/flowchart.jpg" alt="flowchart"></div>
            <p class="center">Figure 3 Flowchart</p>
            <p class="indentation">The smart cane operates through a carefully structured sequence, beginning with its
                initialization upon activation. If the device responds negatively during this phase, indicating a
                failure to initialize correctly, a predefined process is triggered to send the smart cane back for
                further assessment or repair. Conversely, in the case of a positive response, the cane seamlessly moves
                through the next stages of functionality. It employs an ultrasonic sensor to detect nearby objects, and
                upon identifying an object at a distance of 0.034 units, a simultaneous activation of the vibration
                motor and alarm buzzer ensues, providing the user with a clear indication of the proximity of an
                obstacle. Additionally, the device is designed for continuous operation, as a straightforward loop
                restarts the operating system, ensuring reliability in assisting individuals with visual impairments.
            <p class="indentation"> In summary, the smart cane's systematic approach integrates both positive and
                negative responses, offering users an effective and reliable tool for navigating their surroundings. The
                combination of advanced sensor technology, distance assessment, and immediate feedback mechanisms
                contributes to a seamless and dependable user experience, promoting safety and independence for
                individuals with visual impairments.

                The ultrasonic sensor itself is an HC-SR04 module, which has four pins: VCC (5V), GND (ground), Trigger
                (pin 2), and Echo (pin 3). The Trigger pin is connected to digital pin 2 of the Arduino board, and it is
                used to send a short pulse to initiate the ultrasonic measurement. The Echo pin is connected to digital
                pin 3 of the Arduino board, and it receives the reflected ultrasonic signal from the object.
